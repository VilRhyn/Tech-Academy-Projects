# Tech-Academy-Projects


Inside my Project folder you will find almost all of my course assignments.... 

In the main folder the space station website is labeled index.html

If you go into the Visual Studio Code folder and then into the bootstrap4_project, you will find my Cinema website. 

Also I have created a new repository to make my githubpages.io ... 

My online Final Project should be found: vilrhyn.github.io
